# Brief

Many Young Adults struggle to make car payments and lack the skills to take care of their vehicles that drive them to work everyday. This Car Crux App should help those learn the crux of their Vehicle's common issues to keep them safe on the road and drive another day. This app aims to keep track of their latest payments and repairs. On top of that, this app will provide them with the simple knowledge needed to keep their Vehicles in tip-top shape.

## Audience

### Primary Audience

College Students and High School Graduates

We can assume that 90% of these young adults have experienced some kind of diffuclty when running into Car maintenance issues. Most of them have just started their first actual paying job, they still live with their parents, and they frankly don't have a lot of money for making car payments.

### Secondary Audience

College Graduates and Autocross Drivers

These people have already made some money over the past couple years and can easily afford car maintenance issues. But, they can easily be just as disorganized as anyone else. They may lack knowledge on maintaining their vehicles. They may waste hundreds and thousands of dollars on shop repairs when they could easily fix it themselves for cheap. Autocross drivers may want an app that will help them keep track of all the work they put into their cars.  

## Problem

### Primary Problem

College Students and High School Graduates do not have an intuitive app or way that helps them organize and/or learn about Car Maintenance issues. Many apps on the market are not easy or fun to use which makes it harder for those people to take action. They are overwhelmed with car payments and facts from their local dealers and just want the basic knowledge of what is necessary to get fixed and what is not for the best price. 

### Secondary Problem

Many Car dealers will not even tell the customer up front what they are actually paying for and why something needs to be fixed. Sometimes mechanics will do a poor job when performing an oil change and you don't even realize it. Many young adults don't realize they can easily perform maintenance on their vehicles without having to pay for labor. Many of these people need guidance when paying money on parts and labor.

## Solution

Car Crux will allow users to maximize their budgets when making car payments on maintenance. 

They will be able to...
* Keep track of recent maintenances by updating a non-intimidating form depending on the category they choose (oil change, tire change, etc.)
* Find the average prices for car parts and labor
* Have the ability to add multiple Vehicles in a single garage(Hub)
* Have access to a variety of car maintenance tutorials

## Unique Value Proposition

This app will be structured in such a way that someone who is clueless about cars and making car payments will understand a lot more about the steps it takes to save money on car maintenance issues. It will have a fun and intuitive design that will make users want to take action and stay as organized as possible when it comes to reports and budgets for their vehicles.
