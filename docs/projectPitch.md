Primary Audience
College Students and High School Graduates

We can assume that 90% of these young adults have experienced some kind of diffuclty when running into Car maintenance issues. Most of them have just started their first actual paying job, they still live with their parents, and they frankly don't have a lot of money for making car payments.

Secondary Audience
College Graduates and Autocross Drivers

These people have already made some money over the past couple years and can easily afford car maintenance issues. But, they can easily be just as disorganized as anyone else. They may lack knowledge on maintaining their vehicles. They may waste hundreds and thousands of dollars on shop repairs when they could easily fix it themselves for cheap. Autocross drivers may want an app that will help them keep track of all the work they put into their cars.
